Project Overview
This project demonstrates a basic microservice architecture, incorporating key components like:

Eureka Server for service discovery
API Gateway for routing requests
RESTful Services for handling various business operations
Exception Handling to manage errors gracefully
Docker for containerization and easier deployment
Technologies Used
Spring Boot: For building microservices
Eureka: Service discovery
Spring Cloud Gateway: API Gateway
Docker: Containerization
JUnit: For testing
Postman: For API testing
Setup Instructions
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/microservice-example.git
cd microservice-example
Build the project:

Ensure you have Gradle installed, then run:

bash
Copy code
./gradlew build
Start the Eureka Server:

Navigate to the Eureka Server directory and run:

bash
Copy code
./gradlew bootRun
Start the API Gateway:

In a new terminal, navigate to the API Gateway directory and run:

bash
Copy code
./gradlew bootRun
Start the RESTful Services:

Repeat the previous step for each microservice you have implemented.

Access the application:

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080 (or your configured API Gateway port).

Features
Service Discovery: Register and discover services using Eureka.
API Gateway: Centralized entry point for all requests.
Robust REST APIs: Implemented multiple RESTful services.
Error Handling: Global exception handling for better user experience.
Docker Support: Containerized services for easier deployment.
Ongoing Progress
This project is a work in progress as I continue to learn about microservices. I plan to implement additional features such as:

Advanced security measures
Load balancing
CI/CD integration
Feel free to check back for updates!
